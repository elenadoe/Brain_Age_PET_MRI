# PET_MRI_age

Brain age is a term that refers to the prediction of chronological age from neuroimaging data. This project aims to explore the potential of different modalities as the basis for brain age prediction, and their association to cognitive decline in individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Here, we consider 18F-FDG-PET (signal: standardized uptake value ratio) and T1-weighted MRI (signal: mean gray matter volume). Brain age prediction was achieved through nested cross-validation (see pipeline Figure below) and it could be predicted with a mean absolute error of 1.99 and 1.89 years, and a mean deviation of 0.10 and 0.05 years for 18F-FDG-PET and MRI, respectively. Through statistical analyses, we have also shown that brain age from FDG-PET is better associated with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and better predicts pending cognitive decline in a cognitively normal population, while brain age from MRI is better associated with biomarkers of AD and cognitive decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
