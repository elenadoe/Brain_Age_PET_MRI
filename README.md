# PET_MRI_age

Brain age is a term that refers to the prediction of chronological age from neuroimaging data. This project aims to explore the potential of different modalities as the basis for brain age prediction, and their association to cognitive decline in individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Here, we consider 18F-FDG-PET (signal: standardized uptake value ratio) and T1-weighted MRI (signal: mean gray matter volume) for this task. Brain age prediction was achieved through nested cross-validation (see image below) and it could be predicted with a mean absolute error of 1.99 and 1.89 years, and a mean deviation of 0.10 and 0.05 years for 18F-FDG-PET and MRI, respectively.
