# PET_MRI_age

Brain age is a term that refers to the prediction of chronological age from neuroimaging data. This project aims to explore the potential to derive brain age from FDG-PET using machine learning. To date, the vast majority of the literature concerning brain age used MRI data to predict brain age. Therefore, we compared the potential of FDG-PET to predict brain age by comparing prediction performance to MRI-based prediction. We evaluate training performance by means of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination ($'R^2'$)
